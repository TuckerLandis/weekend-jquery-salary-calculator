Weekend Salary Calculator

## Description

This program displays a table on the DOM in which to input an employees information, and display a calculated monthly cost related to salaries inputted for each employee.
I solved this by writing 3 functions, 1 to submit the employee via the inputs on the page, and append that information as a new row on the DOM, and secondarily to calculate monthly salary in a second function, called in the first.
The third function is to delete one row or employee, and recalculate via calling the calculate function. Within the calculate function, i've included logic to compare the total monthly cost to $20,000, and display a visual warning of a red flashing section if this exceeds $20,000.
